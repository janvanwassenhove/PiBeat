# Priority Order:
# 1. System environment variables (e.g., set via Windows System Properties or 'export' in shell)
# 2. .env file variables (this file, when copied to .env)
# 3. localStorage (configured via the Settings UI in the app)
# 
# The app now properly reads system environment variables via Tauri.
# System env vars are more secure and persist across application restarts.
